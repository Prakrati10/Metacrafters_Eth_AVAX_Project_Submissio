## Introduction 

The code represents a Solidity smart contract named Exception that showcases exception handling using require(), assert(), and revert() statements. Overall The main objective of this smart contract is to demonstrate different ways of handling exceptions and errors in Solidity.

## Code Explanation - Error Handling Solidity Contract

This Solidity contract, named Error, serves as a simple example to demonstrate various error handling mechanisms in Solidity. It includes the usage of require(0, assert(), and revert() to handle different types of errors that can occur during smart contract execution.

pragma solidity ^0.8.10;

contract Error {

    function testRequire(uint _i) public pure {

        require(_i > 10, "Input must be greater than 10");
    }

    function testRevert(uint _i) public pure {
    
        if (_i <= 10) {
            revert("Input must be greater than 10");
        }
    }

    uint public num;

    function testAssert() public view {

        assert(num == 0);
    }

    error InsufficientBalance(uint balance, uint withdrawAmount);

    function testCustomError(uint _withdrawAmount) public view {
        
        uint bal = address(this).balance;
        if (bal < _withdrawAmount) {
            revert InsufficientBalance({balance: bal, withdrawAmount: _withdrawAmount});
        }
    }
}
```

The contract ExceptionHandling is defined, and it contains three functions for demonstrating different error-handling mechanisms in Solidity: require, assert, and revert.

**testRequire Function:**

The testRequire function is a publicly accessible and pure function in Solidity, designed to validate a numerical input parameter _i. It utilizes the require statement to enforce a condition that _i must be greater than 10. If the condition is not met, an error message "Input must be greater than 10" is thrown, preventing further execution. This function is useful for input validation in smart contracts, ensuring that only valid inputs meeting specified criteria are processed, contributing to the integrity and security of the blockchain application.

**testRevert Function:**

The testRevert function, implemented in Solidity and declared as a publicly accessible and pure function, serves as an input validation mechanism. It checks whether the numerical parameter _i is less than or equal to 10. If this condition is true, the function triggers a revert operation with the error message "Input must be greater than 10," effectively reverting the state changes and halting further execution. This function is instrumental in maintaining the integrity of smart contract logic, ensuring that inputs conform to specified requirements and preventing undesired state changes when invalid conditions are encountered.

**testAssert Function:**

The testAssert function, defined as a publicly accessible and view function in Solidity, employs the assert statement to verify a specific condition. In this case, it checks whether the variable num is equal to zero. If the condition evaluates to false, the assert statement triggers an exception, reverting the state and halting further execution. This function is commonly used for critical checks where deviations from expected conditions indicate potential errors or vulnerabilities. By enforcing the requirement that num must be zero, the function helps ensure the integrity of the smart contract's state and behavior, providing a safeguard against unexpected or undesirable situations.
