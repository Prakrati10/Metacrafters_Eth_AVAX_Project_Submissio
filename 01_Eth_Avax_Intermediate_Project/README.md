## Introduction 

The code represents a Solidity smart contract named Exception that showcases exception handling using require(), assert(), and revert() statements. Overall The main objective of this smart contract is to demonstrate different ways of handling exceptions and errors in Solidity.

## Code Explanation - Error Handling Solidity Contract

This Solidity contract, named ErrorHandlingContract, serves as a simple example to demonstrate various error handling mechanisms in Solidity. It includes the usage of require, assert, and revert to handle different types of errors that can occur during smart contract execution.|

contract ExceptionHandling {

    // Function that uses 'require' for input validation
    function RequireTest(uint a, uint b) public pure {
        require(a + b < 10, "Ensure that the combined total of the provided numbers remains below 10.");
    }

    // Function that uses 'assert' for checking a condition
    function AssertTest(uint c) public pure {
        assert(c >= 5);
    }

    // Function that uses 'revert' with a custom error message
    function RevertTest(uint d, uint e) public pure {
        if (d + e > 10) {
            revert("Please ensure that the sum of the entered numbers does not exceed 10.");
        }
    }
}
```

The contract ExceptionHandling is defined, and it contains three functions for demonstrating different error-handling mechanisms in Solidity: require, assert, and revert.

**RequireTest Function:**

This function takes two unsigned integer parameters, a and b.
It uses the require statement to validate that the sum of a and b is less than 10. If this condition is not met, the function reverts and provides the error message "Ensure that the combined total of the provided numbers remains below 10."
The purpose of this function is to check and ensure that a condition holds true, typically used for input validation.

**AssertTest Function:**

This function takes an unsigned integer parameter, c.
It uses the assert statement to check if c is greater than or equal to 5. If this condition is not met, the function reverts.
Unlike require, assert is used for conditions that should always be true, and it ensures that a critical invariant is not violated.

**RevertTest Function:**

This function takes two unsigned integer parameters, d and e.
It uses a conditional statement to check if the sum of d and e is greater than 10. If this condition is met, the function explicitly calls revert with the custom error message "Please ensure that the sum of the entered numbers does not exceed 10."
revert is often used for custom error handling, allowing developers to provide descriptive error messages, and it gracefully reverts the transaction when necessary.
